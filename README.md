# Spring-MVC-WebAPP

Development of a simple Spring MVC Web Application. It is a Basic Todo Management Application with Login and Logout functionalities.

I learnt about:

   - DispatcherServlet
   - Basic Todo Management Application with Login/Logout
   - Model, Controllers, ViewResolver and Filters
   - Forms - DataBinding, Validation
   - Annotation based approach - @RequestParam, @PathVariable, @ModelAttribute, @SessionAttributes etc
   - Bootstrap to style the page
   - Spring Security
   - Internationalization
   - Exception Handling
   - Basic REST Services
   - And how to configure maven and pom.xml to use tomcat and run it through iTerm in macOS.

If you want to run the webApp with tomcat check your tomcat configuration (for localhost:8080) and the link for the first page should be http://localhost:8080/myapp/login

I am still working on this project, and want to implement a DB after everything is working properly.
