# Spring-MVC-WebAPP

Development of a simple Spring MVC Web Application. It is a Basic Todo Management Application with Login and Logout functionalities.

I learnt about:

   - DispatcherServlet
   - Basic Todo Management Application with Login/Logout
   - Model, Controllers, ViewResolver and Filters
   - Forms - DataBinding, Validation
   - Annotation based approach - @RequestParam, @PathVariable, @ModelAttribute, @SessionAttributes etc
   - Bootstrap to style the page
   - Spring Security
   - Internationalization
   - And how to configure maven and pom.xml to use tomcat and run it through iTerm in macOS.
   
   - I am currently implementing a DB using mySQL and Hibernate

If you want to run the webApp with tomcat check your tomcat configuration (for localhost:8080) and the URL for the first page should be http://localhost:8080/myapp/login and if using macOS on iterm run the command: mvn tomcat7:deploy.
